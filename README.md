# Flappy-Pixie 🐓
>Browser clone of flappy bird built in three.js. In order to prevent good players from breaking the game by exceeding player position thresholds and eventually losing floating-point precision the game teleports back when needed. It is made out of 2 tiles, starting one = 0, and second which is mirrored = 1,-1. When player reaches center of tile 1 he is teleported back to the center of -1.
